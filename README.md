# Image Storage

## Purpose
This repository is a centralized storage solution used as an alternate src of image assets from firebase storage for Android apps.

---

## Structure
The repository is organized as follows:


- **`appName`**: individual apps to store specific assets.

---

## Usage
1. **Adding Images**: Place the image files in the appropriate app-specific folder.
2. **Referencing Images**: Use the files in your Android projects via URLs or as bundled assets.

---

## Best Practices
- Use optimized image formats (e.g., `.webp` or `.png`) to reduce file size and improve performance.
- Follow a consistent naming convention (e.g., `featureName.png`).
